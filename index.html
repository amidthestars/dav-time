              <h2>Lecture 1: Introduction (Week 3)</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Introduction to the project</li>
                <li>This is the FPGA project, why FPGAs?</li>
                <li>General purpose CPU vs FPGA vs ASIC</li>
                <li>How do we program them? It's Verilog time</li>
                <li>
                  Introduction to Verilog - modules, wires, bitwise review
                </li>
                <li>Introduction to our FPGA in particular</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Explanation: </strong> I'm putting all of the
                introductory information to the project in the first lecture, to
                give students a high-level view of what they'll be working with.
                Verilog will be somewhat covered, with an emphasis on how it's
                different than other programming languages that students may
                have seen before, but most of the teaching of Verilog will be
                done separately.
              </p>
              <h2>DAV'ing: Quartus Setup + Questa Reading + Verilog</h2>
              <p>
                Quartus was one of the hardest things to set up, so being there
                in person to help students set it up would be optimal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Questa also has some quirks that might be helpful to teach in
                person.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, while Lecture 1 does cover some basic Verilog, which
                will be enough to help students do the first lab, this
                worksession / workshop will be a chance for students to ask
                questions and get a head start on the lab.

                multiplexers will be covered. Information on the basic logic
                gates will be included in the slides as a recap, but may not be
                emphasized.

                FPGA; peripherals and more capstone related topics will be
                covered in the next quarter.

                <strong>Explanation: </strong>This is the last lecture that
                applies to both tracks, so it will be covered first. From here
                on out, people in either track can choose to specialize to
                conserve their time. Project proposals will probably have to

        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            <strong>DAV already has a strong foundation.</strong> The goal is to
            continue to refine DAV to make it more established and concrete, so
            that others may be able to use DAV's curriculum (DAV 2.0!).
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, adding to DAV at this point doesn't make too much
            sense. Assuming future leads (like now) join DAV and complete one of
            the two tracks, they can learn the other after they become leads.
            Adding more material would steepen the learning curve, and future
            leads may find more additions hard to keep.
